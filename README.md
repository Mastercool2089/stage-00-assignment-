FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON CANCER DIAGNOSTIC 



The present century along with the remarkable development of technology has brought about great changes in all fields. Along with that, the rapidly spreading outbreak of the covid  epidemic in 2019 has caused all activities to move online including healthcare. Facing with a critical situation during the epidemic along with dealing with an enormous number of patients and having to distance between individuals, the presence of an application or web app is extremely necessary for clinics and hospitals. Through the days of the outbreak, there is a need for a medical application that is used to manage patients remotely and ensures the convenience for patients and medical staff. Precisely, storing data as well as booking appointments are prioritized. Therefore, this thesis will focus on building a web application to bring medical staff and cancer patients a great experience in treatment by storing and tracking medical examination results together with other.



WHAT THE WORK OF A FRONTEND DEVELOPER ?

A frontend developer will be responsible for developing, enhancing, and designing a world-class web application and healthcare portal.



Your role will include implementing, and enhancing the features on the web portal on regular basis as per the requirements,You will be responsible for choosing libraries and frameworks to best meet the needs of the application.Unit-testing code for robustness, including edge cases, usability, and general reliabilityIdentify and correct bottlenecks and fix bugs, Design, build, and maintain high performance, reusable, and reliable source code Help maintain code quality, organization, and automatization, Coordinate with other application development team, BS/MS or higher degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Proven software development experience and REACT skills development,Proven working experience in development Using React framework for web application development, Understanding of design patterns.

IMPACTS OF FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT ON CANCER DIAGNOSTIC.

          Cancer is characterized by the rampant proliferation, growth, and infiltration of malignantly transformed cancer cells past their normal boundaries into adjacent tissues. It is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for million new diagnoses and million deaths globally in this century. It is now well recognized that a proactive approach in the early diagnosis of cancer is key to enhance the efficacy of cancer management by improving the efficacy of most therapies with minimum side effects thereby providing extended survival with good quality of life. Many conceptual and technological advancement that has taken place in the posthuman genomic area coupled with a blast in the computational technologies that the world has witnessed in the last few decades has not only strengthened the classical diagnostic methods that existed for more than several decades, but has also given rise to the development of a number of novel approaches for early, reliable and faster diagnosis of cancer.

Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is a next generation cancer knowledge network established by the Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) to support the hosting, standardization, and distribution of genomic and clinical data from cancer research programs. The GDC consists of several applications which require support for front-end development and maintenance. The primary objectives of the GDC Front-End Development effort are as follows:

 • Develop and maintain GDC front-end components within existing GDC applications including the GDC Data Portal, GDC Data Submission Portal, GDC AWG Portals, and GDC DTT UI

 • Develop a data visualization and analysis tool framework which will allow GDC and other 3rd party apps operate within the GDC Data Portal 

• Develop and enhance GDC data visualization and analysis tools made available through the GDC Data Portal

 • Maintain the GDC Web and Documentation Sites

         

            CASE STUDY

           The World Health Organization recommends incorporating patient-reported experience measures and patient-reported outcome measures to ensure care processes. New technologies, such as mobile apps, could help report and monitor patients’ adverse effects and doubts during treatment. However, engaging patients in the daily use of mobile apps is a challenge that must be addressed in accordance with the needs of people. Her objectives was to present a qualitative case study documenting the process of identifying the information needs of breast cancer patients and health care professionals during the treatment process in a Chilean cancer institution. The study aims to identify patients’ information requirements for integration into a mobile app that accompanies patients throughout their treatment while also providing features for reporting adverse symptoms. The method used was that conducted focus groups with breast cancer patients who were undergoing chemotherapy (n=3) or who completed chemotherapy between 3 months and 1 year (n=1). The WHO  also surveyed health care professionals (n=9) who were involved in patient care and who belonged to the oncology committee of the cancer center where the study took place. Content analysis was applied to the responses to categorize the information needs and the means to satisfy them. A user interface was designed according to the findings of the focus groups and was assessed by 3 trained information system and user interaction design experts from 2 countries, using heuristic evaluation guidelines for mobile apps. The result where obtained and recorded as thus ;Patients’ information needs were classified into 4 areas: an overview of the disease, information on treatment and day-to-day affairs, assistance on the normality and abnormality of symptoms during treatment, and symptoms relevant to report. Health care professionals required patients to be provided with information on the administrative and financial process. We noted that the active involvement of the following 4 main actors is required to satisfy the information needs: patients, caregivers, social network moderators, and health professionals.

FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT

The remarkable development of technology has brought about great changes in all fields .In consideration the rapid spreading outbreak of the corona Virus in 2019 has shifted all activities to move online including healthcare. Dealing with a critical situation during the epidemic along with facing with an enormous number of patients and having to distance between individuals,  the presence of an application or web app was extremely necessary for clinics and hospitals.  

During the period of the outbreak,  there was a need for a medical application that is used to manage patients remotely and ensures the convenience for patients and medical staff. Therefore,  this thesis focus on frontend development (i.e building a web application) to bring medical staff and patients a great experience in treatment  by storing and tracking medical examination results.

Frontend development, also known as Client-side development,  is the method of creating the user interface and experience of a website or web application using framework, programming language and tools. It priorities creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website that users interact with directly. 

A frontend development is responsible for enhancing and designing a world-class web application and healthcare portal for storing data as well as booking appointments.

During the year 2020, the World Health Organization recommends the use of patient-reported experience measures and patient-reported outcome measures to ensure care processes. New technologies such as mobile applications was used to monitor patients adverse effects and doubts during treatment. WHO objectives was to present a qualitative case study documenting the process of identifying the information needs to breast cancer patients and healthcare professionals during the treatment process.

Frontend development requires the use of various technologies to create responsive, interactive, and engaging web pages, including:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): for structuring content
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): for styling and layout
3. JavaScript: for adding interactivity and dynamic effects
4. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js: for building complex applications
5. Libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap: for simplifying development
6. Tools like Webpack and Babel: for optimizing and bundling code

Frontend development involves:

1. Design implementation: turning designs into functional web pages
2. UI/UX development: creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces
3. Responsive design: ensuring websites work on various devices and screens
4. Browser compatibility: ensuring websites work across different browsers
5. Accessibility: ensuring websites are usable by people with disabilities
6. Performance optimization: improving website loading speed and efficiency

Frontend developers work closely with backend developers, designers, and project managers to create a seamless user experience.
